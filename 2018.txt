Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems
The Knowledge Graph contains a wealth of information and data that Google uses to show users how facts, people and places are connected to each other and to deliver more focused and relevant search results.
Data preprocessing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format.

Data management is the practice of organizing and maintaining data processes to meet ongoing information lifecycle needs.
Data curation is the management of data throughout its lifecycle, from creation and initial storage to the time when it is archived for posterity or becomes obsolete and is deleted. The main purpose of data curation is to ensure that data is reliably retrievable for future research purposes or reuse.

seqwa - help decision makers make better decisions by giving immediate analysis of date
	-create questions of data
	autogenerated questions
	see relevant visualizations

	console - user can put in own questions
		NLP
	dont know what kind of questions to ask
	looking for someone who can help with
		basic grouping
		mapping based visualizations
			data set - identify column based off city, zip code


1. dataset
	pose questions - get to know background of data
	summary of data set - numerical/categorical
		statistics
	interaction of variables
		plotting data
		see missing values, anomilies, outliers
	model generated
	make sure not overfitting
	keep notes of transformations,

Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing.

daily report fill in
	help you understand what you learned

see if new changes to replication will be useful to pepple
	measuring people's engagmements
	java backend, angular frontened (working)

	see website, check data points that can be collected
	infer from searchengines, data points on each page. paint user's picture - create profile of user 

	set up metrics

	GET IDEA OF WHAT PERSON IS - goal.
		ie person with finance background - see how to identify is person of this background
	have email name organization. get sense of categories
	psychographics / market research
		user rate certain question
		think as perspective marketing understand user
	find out what we want to find out and then collect data
	make psychographic analysis graphic of each person

	every day
		go through every page make ui ux perspective
		what people are interested in going to
		making a list of things of things that will help you make a list of things helpful to each person
		there will sample data

		whatever i see go through data points
		write a little about why we need certain data point
			external sources
		throrough report on what to collect

			later get into technical and how to implement
			internal admin screen later
		every day be detailed as possible - weekly report will be main points
	daily/weekly/final report

	friday/

	tomorrow - go through website, see what impressions are, potential data points
	what more information we could collect

	wednesday @ 8
--------------------------------------------------------------
find all universities, scientific papers, etc
--------------------------------------------------------------
any button = data point
	series of steps??
	think of nikhil as customer, how to help him?
	create proper report RIP (page title, table of contents, proper headings/margins, page numbers, introduction/abstract, body, conclusions)
		communicate with higher ups

	identify all data points we can collect. draw diagram take screenshot of tableau
		put image in document, collect this information from this button
			how long staying on this screen
			how often have they shared utilizations
			how often exported
		what they might be collecting
		as user what would you do
			think as user and think as data scientist
			will not be able to analyze uploaded data

		beta test - inviting people to try out, then we can see how they're using it, how often clicking on something, logging into page
		put urself in shoes of data scientist

		monday @ 8 pm
