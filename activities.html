							<h1>USC</h1>
							<h2>USC Interation Lab</h2>
								<p>I have recently joined the Interaction Lab, known for its socially assitive robots. You can learn about it <a href="http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/index.php">here</a>. I am working with Kate-Swift Spong on the EAGER project. Our goal is to create a socially assistive robot that increases a person's motivation for doing physical activities and exercise. Previous work done can be found on the <a href="http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/sponsors/desc.php?name=eager">Interaction Lab website</a>. As a result of working on this project, I have become familiar with ROS.

							<h2>HackSC Junior</h2>
								<p>HackSC Jr. is an one day hackathon that gives kids in grades 4-12 an opportunity to learn, explore, question, tinker and build through a one-day programming challenge. We emphasize diversity as well as the intersectional nature of tech and everyday life, demonstrating the various ways companies and people use computer science in their operations and encouraging attendees to continue learning outside of the event. Check out our website <a href="https://hackscjr.org/">here</a>. <br /> <br />

								As part of the Logistics/Operations committee, I help organize the event to ensure that it runs smoothly. We will be hosting our event on March 31, 2018!</p>

							<h2>VEX Robotics</h2>
								<p>VEX is a robotics competition with the goal of building and designing a robot to play a game. This year, the game revolves around moving mobile goals to designated zones and stacking cones. I have worked on the software side of our robot. We have competed in various competitions and will be going to the VEX Worlds Competition in late April!

							<h2>USC ACM/IEEE/AAAI</h2>
								<p>I am actively involved in these 3 professional organizations.</p>
							<h1>Monta Vista</h1>
							<h2>Yearbook</h2>
								<p>As a head editor for Monta Vista's Yearbook during my senior year, I helped lead the overall vision of our Yearbook. I reviewed every page and trained a group of 25 students. I ensured that they were meeting deadlines and worked in a hierarchical structure, delegating tasks to section editors as necessary. In 2015-2016, I was the Senior Ads Editor, where I helped organize the purchases of Senior Ads in the Yearbook. I communicated with parents and Monta Vista staff members to ensure that they were happy with the pages that were being created, as most of them were surprises for the students.

							<h2>Science Olympiad</h2>
							<p>As a freshman, I worked with upperclassmen to bring Science Olympiad to Monta Vista.<br /><br />

								After winning six individual medals in my first two years of competing at the regional and state levels, I realized that team wins were more important to me. I mentored new members in my junior year, and decided to be an alternate to ensure that my mentees could compete. I was really happy when they won! I am currently the Vice President of Team Management, where I help mentor the teams and enhance overall group effort. I work to resolve any conflicts over events and have recently organized events to help with team bonding.<br /><br />

								Science Olympiad is a team sport. We have emphasized collaboration and unity and have grown to new levels of performance every year. I am proud that I was one of the key founders of the Monta Vista Science Olympiad Club.
